## 🚀 Your Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Replace Normal CSS with Tailwind CSS
- Remove the existing `styles.css` file.
- Add Tailwind CDN in your HTML file inside `<head>`:
    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    ```
- Recreate the styles using Tailwind utility classes directly in the `index.html` file.
